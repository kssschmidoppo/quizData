progect review


it was nice to follow  coach thoughts...
but some how i feel like i didnt had time for my now researches.

it was very interesting to understand how boring database, not as boring at the end :) 

i had an issue with styling, so how it didn't show the result of my changes as quickly as it could be ( it ever showed the next day) so i gave up 

thank you for another mindblowing experience
